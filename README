TrafficModeling-ErlangB version 0.01
====================================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

TESTING

To run the tests just run

   make test

as previously said. Version 0.02 includes a test suite based upon ITU tables
for Erlang B, available for free in variuos versions at

   http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-d/dept/psp/ssb/planitu/plandoc/erlangt.html

The adherence of module's formulas to the table are still under test; at the moment, to make the tests against these tables pass in my machine I did the following:

* to test the gos function, I accepted an absolute error less than 1e-4. Note that this is not acceptable at the moment, because lhe lowest value for GoS in the table is 1e-5;

* to test the traffic function, I accepted an absolute error less than 3%, which again doesn't apply well for lower values of traffic;

* to test the servers function, I had to scale the traffic a bit. This is necessary to cope with roundoff and finite machine precision, due to the fact that the number of servers is always an integer number. This is probably the most acceptable function at the moment with respect the table, but also note that it's based upon the gos() function.

The trembling adherence to the table does not surprise me very much; the table I'm using actually should be applied only to the traffic function based on its construction. I also fear that ITU guys rounded off a bit.

DEPENDENCIES

None at the moment.
